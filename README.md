# Important information

Today (Tuesday 2nd March 2021), Microsoft released patches for multiple different on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server zero-day vulnerabilities that are being exploited by a nation-state affiliated group.  The vulnerabilities exist in on-premises Exchange Servers 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019.  
 
Your Microsoft Customer Success Account Manager and Technical Support Teams will be engaging with your technical teams to assist in addressing this issue.  We wanted to ensure you were aware of the situation and would ask that you help drive immediate remediation steps.
 
For on-premises Exchange Servers, we ask that you direct your teams to start immediate action to assess your Exchange infrastructure and patch vulnerable servers, with the first priority being servers which are accessible from the Internet (e.g., servers publishing Outlook on the web/OWA and ECP).  To patch these vulnerabilities, you should move to the latest Exchange Cumulative Updates and then install the relevant security updates on each Exchange Server.  You can use the Exchange Server Health Checker script, which can be downloaded from GitHub (use the latest release). Running this script will tell you if you are behind on your on-premises Exchange Server updates (note that the script does not support Exchange Server 2010). 
 
We also recommend that your security team assess whether or not the vulnerabilities were being exploited by using the Indicators of Compromise we shared here -

We are committed to working with you through this issue.  Your Microsoft account and support teams have been fully mobilized.  Please let me know if you need additional help.
